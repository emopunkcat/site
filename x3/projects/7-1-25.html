            <p>Ive spent way too much time researching audio gear, frequency responses, different curves, headphone styles, etc. The thing is, the more i tried different headphones where people claimed to be the &quot;best&quot;, the more it made me realize why music taste exist (outside of preference). You have genres where the mids are more present, and lacking anything below 120hz, but then more of the terminally online music is treble spike and distorted 60hz bass. How can a company manufacture a headphone that tailors to all of these spectrums?? from what ive experienced in the many headphones i bought they DONT and you need to research before you just buy a pair of headphones.</p>
            <p>Ive tried headphones from the Audio Technica M30x price range all the way up to my current headphones, the Sennheiser 660s2. But my conclusion stays the same. Some songs with more complex stereo or alot going on, the 660s2 allows me to hear more of that detail instead of just mudding it all out. But EDM type songs sound better on the 60$ M30x&#039;s. So then whats the point of spending 600 dollars on a headphone if half the music you listen to will sound like shit on it? You need to look at frequency response. Obviously its not EVERYTHIING, but its a pretty clear indicator of how a headphone will sound. for EDM/trap stuff you want some decent sub bass, and nice treble. For your more acoustic music, your looking for a smooth midrange, and overall flat response. you can look for headphones in between these if you want a one shotter, but i do recommend a few.</p>
            <p>GET A PAIR OF DT990 250ohm with stock pads. Or if you prefer IEM, the simgot em6l. these use a very nice response that is tailored for many genres, no spiking, very transparent and wide soundstage. While my 660s2&#039;s sound good, it takes a bit of EQ to get the bass and treble I want out of them. Theres also the DT770 which is the closed back version of the DT990, however I found them rather lacking in subbass actually, when compared to my M30x. I guess it makes sense since they are monitoring HPs but expected more from a closed back.</p>
            <p>Anyways I really hope I find a pair of bluetooth headphones that fit my listening style soon, because I am &quot;satisfied&quot; with my wired 660s2&#039;s as of right now, they are transparent and i can close my eyes and just get lost in the music. But for bluetooth HPs, I currently use the Bose NC700, which have excellent ANC, however I find myself often tweaking the EQ often because of treble spikes. They have great subbass, and it can get a little muddy at times but its nothing compared to those awful Sony XM4s. Id be interested in trying out some of Moondrops new headphones, but from what ive seen online they arent all that hot, but moondrop can make a great product so id just have to try for myself.</p>
