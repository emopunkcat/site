            <p>honestly, making this site i only had one goal in mind - keep everything to the absolute minimum. just text and image. dont want any fancy shit, just something that lets me broadcast to the world. whilst making this, i created these pages to document things id like the world to see. i have so many ideas of things id like to add and functionality, but for now its a great way for me to just spill my brain to the internet. also for my pentesting friends, ill tell u right now theres nothing of interest in trying to run scans or anything its legit just html files and images (which are in sources/image)</p>
            <p>id like to document projects or happenings in my life that id liek the world to see - obviously i could post on social media, but a medium like this is much more tailored to me. no bs, no ads, no distractions, just pure thought and myself. if ur seeing this, have a good day and dont forget to tell those close to you that they are loved</p>
